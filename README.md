Huge **thank you** to Colin McIntosh of [SheetsResume.com](https://sheetsresume.com/) for freely sharing the docx template this is based on.
I originally found the template in Colin's [massively popular post in r/jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/).
